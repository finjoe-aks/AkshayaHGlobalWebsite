          What are Relational Data Models ?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Relational Data Model is the primary data model which is used widely around the world for data storage and 
          processing. This model is simple and it has all the properties and capabilities required to process data with 
          storage efficiency.
        </p>

        <h4>
          Concepts :
        </h4>
        <h4>
          Tables
        </h4>
        <p>
          In relational data model, relations are saved in the format of Tables. This format stores the relation 
          among entities. A table has rows and columns, where rows represents records and columns represent the 
          attributes.
        </p>
        <h4>
          Tuple
        </h4>
        <p>
          A single row of a table, which contains a single record for that relation is called a tuple.
        </p>
        <h4>
          Relation Instance
        </h4>
        <p>
          A finite set of tuples in the relational database system represents relation instance. Relation 
          instances do not have duplicate tuples.
        </p>
        <h4>
          Relation Schema
        </h4>
        <p>
          A relation schema describes the relation name (table name), attributes, and their names.
        </p>
        <h4>
          Relation Key
        </h4>
        <p>
          Each row has one or more attributes, known as relation key, which can identify the row in 
          the relation (table) uniquely.
        </p>
        <h4>
          Attribute domain
        </h4>
        <p>
          Every attribute has some pre-defined value scope, known as attribute domain.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h4>
          Constraints
        </h4>
        <p>
          Every relation has some conditions that must hold for it to be a valid relation. 
          These conditions are called Relational Integrity Constraints. 
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h4>
          Key Constraints
        </h4>
        <p>
          There must be at least one minimal subset of attributes in the relation, which can identify a 
          tuple uniquely. This minimal subset of attributes is called key for that relation. 
          If there are more than one such minimal subsets, these are called candidate keys.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a relation with a key attribute, no two tuples can have identical values for key attributes.
        </p>
        <p>
          A key attribute can not have NULL values.
        </p>
        <p>
          Key constraints are also referred to as Entity Constraints.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h4>
          Domain Constraints
        </h4>
        <p>
          Domain Constraints are the definition of a valid set of values for an attribute. The data type
          of domain includes string, character, integer, time, date, currency, etc. The value of the attribute must be 
          available in the corresponding domain.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h4>
          Referential integrity Constraints
        </h4>
        <p>
          A referential integrity constraint is defined as part of an association between two entity types. 
          Referential integrity constraints work on the concept of Foreign Keys. A foreign key is a key attribute of 
          a relation that can be referred in other relation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Referential Integrity refers to the ability of the database to keep related data from being corrupted.
        </p>
        <p>
          Referential integrity constraint states that if a relation refers to a key attribute of a different or 
          same relation, then that key element must exist.

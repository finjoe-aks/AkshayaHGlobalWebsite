          What are ER Diagrams ?
        </h2>
        <p>
          ER Diagrams stands for Entity Relationship Diagrams. ER Diagrams are the conceptual view of a database. At VIEW 
          LEVEL, ER Diagrams are a good option for designing databases.
        </p>

        <h4>
          What is an Entity ?
        </h4>
        <p>
          An entity is an object or component of data. An entity is represented as an rectangle in ER Diagrams. For
          example, in a school database, students, teachers and classes are considered as entities.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h4>
          What is a Weak Entity ?
        </h4>
        <p>
          An entity that cannot be uniquely identified by its own attributes and relies on the relationship with 
          other entity is called a weak entity. A weak entity is represented by a double rectangle. For example a 
          bank account cannot be uniquely identified without knowing the bank to which the account belongs, so bank 
          account is a weak entity.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h4>
          What is an Attribute ?
        </h4>
        <p>
          An attribute describes the property of an entity. An attribute is represented as an Oval in ER Diagrams. For
          example, in a student entity, age, name and class are considered as attributes. 
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h4>
          Types of Attributes :
        </h4>
        <h4>
          Key Attribute
        </h4>
        <p>
          A key attribute can uniquely identify an entity. An key attribute is represented as an oval and the text inside 
          it is underlined. For example, student roll number can uniquely identify a student.
        </p>
        <h4>
          Composite Attribute
        </h4>
        <p>
          A composite attribute is an attribute that is a combination of other attributes. For example, In 
          student entity, the student address is a composite attribute as an address is composed of other attributes such 
          as pin code, state and country.
        </p>
        <h4>
          Multivalued Attribute
        </h4>
        <p>
          A multivalued attribute is an attribute which can have multiple values. It is represented by double ovals in 
          ER Diagrams. For example, a person can have multiple phone numbers.
        </p>
        <h4>
          Derived Attribute
        </h4>
        <p>
          A derived attribute is an attribute which is derived from another attribute. It is represented by dashed ovals 
          in ER Diagrams. For example, the age of a person changes overtime, so it can be derived from "Date Of Birth" 
          entity.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h4>
          What is a Relationship ?
        </h4>
        <p>
          A relationship is the relation between entities. It is represented as diamond boxes and connected to entities by 
          single lines in ER Diagrams. For example, a student entity and a college entity have the relationship "study".
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h4>
          Types of Relationships :
        </h4>
        <h4>
          One to One Relationship
        </h4>
        <p>
          In an One to One Relationship a instance single of an entity is related with an single instance of another 
          entity. For example, A person can have only one passport and one passport can be given to only one person.
        </p>
        <h4>
          One to Many Relationship
        </h4>
        <p>
          In an One to Many Relationship a instance single of an entity is related with many instances of another 
          entity. For example, A person can have many phone numbers but a phone number can be given to only one person.
        </p>
        <h4>
          Many to Many Relationship
        </h4>
        <p>
          In an Many to Many Relationship many instances of an entity is related with many instances of another 
          entity. For example, a can be assigned to many projects and a project can be assigned to many students.

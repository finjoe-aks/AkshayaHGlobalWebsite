          <p>Our aim is to create a guide in the form of a website, so we do not forget our knowledge in coding and
          also learn new things. We have written almost all the things we know and learnt about coding. Whenever we forget some tags or
          properties, we look through our own pages or the pages created by our friends.</p>

          <p>We are a group of 4 students studying in ninth grade. Each one of us is highly trained
            and experienced in programming. This website is the result of all our new and
            past experiences in html and css. Our website contains only CSS and HTML and no other front-end or back-end programming languages.

          <p>We know that our website will help you in some way related to HTML, CSS and DBMS. If you ever forget some elements
            or units, you can check out our HTML, CSS and other menus. If you don't find the answer you're looking for, then leave a feedback and we'll look out for solutions.
            We keep updating our website, so a few facts that aren't available today might be available in the future.

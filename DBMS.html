          What is a database ?
        </h3>
        <p>
          A database is an organized collection of structured data which can be easily managed and accessed.
          It's usually managed and controlled by a DBMS.
        </p>
        <h3>
          What is DBMS ?
        </h3>
        <p>
          DBMS stands for Data Base Management System. DBMS is a software used for storing and retrieving users's data. 
          The language used to to tasks in DBMS is called SQL. The DBMS accepts the request for data from 
          an application and instructs the operating system to provide the specific data. DBMS allows users
          to create their own databases as per their requirement. 
        </p>
        <h3>
          Characterstics of DBMS
        </h3>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              A DBMS is more realistic and uses real-world entities to design it's architecture.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
              DBMS allows entities and relations among them to form tables. A user can understand 
              the architecture of a database just by looking at the table names.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
              DBMS follows the rules of normalization, Normalization is a process that reduces data redundancy. 
              A DBMS splits a relation when any of its attributes is having redundancy in values.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
              Every relation in a database remains consistent. There are techniques and methods which can detect 
              attempt of leaving database in inconsistent state.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
              A database system is entirely  different than its data. A database is an active entity, whereas data
              is said to be passive, on which the database works and organizes. DBMS also stores metadata, which 
              is data about data, to ease its own process.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
              DBMS offers multiple views for different users. For example, A person from the construction department 
              will have a different view of the database than a person from the purcahse department.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
              DBMS offers security. Users will not be able to access data of other users and departments. DBMS offers 
              many different levels of security features, which enables multiple users to have different views with 
              different features. Since a DBMS is not saved on the disk as traditional file systems, it is very hard 
              for miscreants to break the code.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
              DBMS supports multi-user environment and allows them to access and manipulate data in parallel.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
              A DBMS is controlled and managed by SQL (Structured Query Language). It helps the users to easily 
              access, manipulate and retrieve the data.
            </li>

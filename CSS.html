       <p>CSS(Cascading Style Sheets) is used for designing webpages. It describes the way HTML elements should be displayed on the webpage.</p>
       <p>There are 3 ways to write css-Inline, External and Embedded CSS. In inline CSS, the code is written inside the tag itself by using to style tag.
       Inline css are mostly used by beginners because it's easy for them, but it gets really messy when a there's a lot of code present. That's when we use
       external CSS. External CSS is written is a seperate file or folder made for CSS alone. A number of other HTML files can be attatched to the .css file by using the tag:
       <b>link rel="stylesheet" href="<i>name of stylesheet</i>"</b>. Embedded CSS is where we write the stylings inside the style tag in the head tag. This type of
       styling is more organized than inline CSS but still the best method is to use external CSS.</p>

       <h4>Now, let's quickly look at the parts of a CSS style.</h4>
       <img src="images\CSS-parts.JPG" alt="something went wrong!" style="float: left; margin-right: 2em; margin-bottom: 3em;">
       <p>The selector is the area or place where the CSS should be applied. The property defines what type of stylings are to be displayed.
         And lastly the value is the amount of the property to be displayed. The colors such as green, blue, etc are all values of the property color.

       <h2>CSS colors:</h2>
        <p> Using colors properly is a pretty hard jub even for a professional web designer.
          Colors are fairly simple to use but they play a main role in displaying the website. One color used properly will definitely look better
          than a hundred colors used improperly. So it's important that we learn how we use colors and the different ways to wrote them. 
        </p>

          <dt>Names:</dt>
          <dd>Writing down the actual names of the color like "Orange", "Red","SeaGreen", etc.</dd>
          <dt>HEX values:</dt>
          <dd>Hexadecimal color codes are written with a <i>#</i> in front of them to make them work. Examples include <b>#ff0000</b>(red), <b>#40ff00</b>(green), etc.</dd>
          <dt>RGB values:</dt>
          <dd>RGB values are written in terms of the amounts of red, green, and blue in the color. For example, <b>rgb(255, 0, 144)</b> will give a shade of pink.</dd>
          <dt>HSL values:</dt>
          <dd>HSL stands for Hue, Saturation, Lightness and by increasing or decreasing the following values we get dfferent colors. Example: <b>hsl(30Â°, 100%, 40%)</b> will give a dull orange color.</dd>
        </dl>
        <p>There are thousands of values for each values given above. And it's not necessary to memorize each one of
          them. However you have to know atleast a few easy color codes to keep up with today's world.
          For viewing more color codes visit Google's <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=color+picker&oq=color&aqs=chrome.0.69i59j69i57j0i433j69i65l2j69i60l3.2022j1j9&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8" target="_blank">Color picker</a>
           and you can adjust the settings a bit to achieve the color you want. Text editors like VS code have built in color pickers so you don't have to type
           in a query on google everytime.

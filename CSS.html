       <p>CSS(Cascading Style Sheets) is used for designing webpages. It describes the way HTML elements should be displayed on the webpage.</p>
       <p>There are 2 ways to write css-Inline CSS and External CSS. In inline CSS, the CSS code is written inside the tag itself by using to style tag.
       Inline css are mostly used by beginners because it's easy for them, but it gets really messy when a there's a lot of code present. That's when we use
       external CSS. External CSS is written is a seperate file or folder made for CSS alone. A number of other HTML files can be attatched to the CSS file by using the tag:
       <b>link rel="stylesheet" href="<i>name of stylesheet</i>"</b>. There is also another type of CSS which is written between the head tags.
       It's basically an external css written between the head tags of the html document using the <b>style</b> tag. Using this type of CSS will also give the same results as any other type of CSS.</p>

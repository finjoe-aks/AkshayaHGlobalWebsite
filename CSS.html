       <h2>What is CSS ?</h2>
       <p>CSS(Cascading Style Sheets) is used for designing webpages. It describes the way HTML elements should be displayed on the webpage.</p>
       <p><b>There are 3 ways to write css-Inline, External and Embedded CSS.</b></p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
         <li><p>In inline CSS, the code is written inside the tag itself by using to style tag.
         Inline css are mostly used by beginners because it's easy for them.</p></li> 
         <li><p>It gets really messy when a there's a lot of code present. That's when we use
         external CSS. External CSS is written is a seperate file or folder made for CSS alone.
         A number of other HTML files can be attatched to the .css file by using the tag:
         <b>link rel="stylesheet" href="</b><i>name of stylesheet</i><b>".</b></p></li> 
         <li><p>Embedded CSS is where we write the stylings inside the style tag in the head tag. This type of
         styling is more organized than inline CSS but still the best method is to use external CSS.</p></li>
      </ul>

       <h4>Now, let's quickly look at the parts of a CSS style.</h4>
       <img src="images\CSS-parts.JPG" alt="something went wrong!" style="float: left; margin-right: 2em; margin-bottom: 3em;">
       <p>The selector is the area or place where the CSS should be applied. The property defines what type of stylings are to be displayed.
         And lastly the value is the amount of the property to be displayed. The colors such as green, blue, etc are all values of the property color.

       <h2>CSS colors:</h2>
        <p> Using colors properly is a pretty hard job even for a professional web designer.
          Colors are fairly simple to use but they play a main role in displaying the website.  A single color used properly will definitely look better
          than a multiple colors used improperly. So it's important that we learn how we use colors and the different ways to write them.
        </p>
        <dl>
          <dt>Names:</dt>
          <dd>Typing down the actual names of the color like "Orange", "Red","SeaGreen", etc. Color details like
            shades, saturation, lightness may not be availabe while using this method.
          </dd>
          <dt>HEX values:</dt>
          <dd>Hexadecimal color codes are written with a <i>#</i> in front of them to make them work. Examples include <b>#ff0000</b>(red), <b>#40ff00</b>(green), etc.</dd>
          <dt>RGB values:</dt>
          <dd>RGB values are written in terms of the amounts of red, green, and blue in the color. For example, <b>rgb(255, 0, 144)</b> will give a shade of pink.</dd>
          <dt>HSL values:</dt>
          <dd>HSL stands for Hue, Saturation, Lightness and by increasing or decreasing the following values we get dfferent colors. Example: <b>hsl(30Â°, 100%, 40%)</b> will give a dull orange color.</dd>
        </dl>
        <p>There are thousands of values for each values given above. And it's not necessary to memorize each one of
         them. However you have to know atleast a few easy color codes to keep up with today's world.
         For viewing more color codes visit Google's <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=color+picker&oq=color&aqs=chrome.0.69i59j69i57j0i433j69i65l2j69i60l3.2022j1j9&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8" target="_blank">Color picker</a>
         and you can adjust the settings a bit to achieve the color you want. Text editors like VS code have built in color pickers so you don't have to type
         in a query on google everytime.
        </p>

        <p>
          <img src="images\colors-values.JPG" alt="something went wrong!" style="float: left; margin:1.5em 1.5em 0 0">The following code displayed on the
          left with three different color values will give the below result. The text in yellow shows the selector and the
          text in blue indicates the property. These color and background themes are not the same for all text editors.
          Using these values we can give colors to anything from a single full-stop to a whole website. But it's important that
          we choose the right colors. For example, using white or light-coloured text in a dark background or a dark-coloured text
          in a light background will improve the look of the webpage or site.

        <h2>CSS fonts:</h2>
        <p>Fonts have a relatively large role in styling today's text. Fonts are present everywhere from
          word documents to coded websites. Old fonts like serif are not very attractive in modern
          websites. Fonts that are plain and simple like sans-serif are look more pleasing and attractive.
          Fonts are really easy to use and they are not complex like colors. Let's quickly look at how we use them.
        </p>
        <dl>
          <dt>Font-family:</dt>
          <dd>Font-families are the different types of fonts we regularly see in word documents.
            These fonts include serif, sans-serif, roboto, montserrat, Arial and hundreds of more fonts.
          </dd>
          <dt>Font-size:</dt>
          <dd>The font-size property specifies the size of the text displayed on the screen.
            The different values used are pixels, percentages, etc. Values like large, xx-small, small, etc. can also be used
            to specify font-sizes.
          </dd>
          <dt>Font-weight:</dt>
          <dd>Font-weight indicates the boldness of the text. There are values such as
            bold, lighter, bolder, etc. and numerical values from 100 to 900.
          </dd>
          <dt>font-style:</dt>
          <dd>The font-style property allows you make the text appear italicized. There are
            only three values for this property: normal, italic and oblique.
          </dd>
          <dt>font-variant:</dt>
          <dd> The font-variant property allows you to make the text lowercase. Simply use <b>font-variant:small-caps</b>
            to transform the selected letters to lowercase. Unfortunately there's no all-caps option in this property.
           For all caps type in <b>text-transform:uppercase</b> to make the text appear in all-caps.
         </dd>
        </dl>
        <p>Unlike CSS colors, there are only a few properties and values for fonts.
          As there are not much of numerical or decimal values like in colors, it makes it even
          more easier to remember and use the values. Although, the difficult part is that
          fonts do not change the document as colors do and so focusing on fonts more than colors is
          not worth it.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          <img src="images\font-values.JPG" alt="something went wrong!" style="float: left; margin:1.5em 1.5em 0 0">
          The code on the left has all the font properties we discussed above and is written in Visual Studio Code(VS code).
          You may see a few letters are larger than the rest, that's because of the uppercase and lowercase
          letters used. What font-variant does is that it changes all the letters to capital letters and makes them
          a little smaller than usual. The text in the result is not italicized because we have given the font-style property
          a value of normal, so the text will appear as it is.

        <h2>Widths and Heights:</h2>
        <p>
          The width and height attributes are two of the most important properties of a page.
          Even the height of an element can be ignored sometimes, but the width is very important.
          We've all seen and used the scrollbar atleast once in our life. The scroll bar is used when
          the height of the content exceeds the screen height itself; that's normal to all of us. But
          scrolling sideways is not very normal. That's why the width is important. If the width is not specified,
          then a sidebar will be auomatically added to display the content, which of course irritates people.
        </p>
        <dl>
          <dt>Width:</dt>
          <dd>The width of an element such as an image, a div, a block, etc. This property can be
            specified using values like pixels and percentages.
          </dd>
          <dt>Height:</dt>
          <dd> The height attribute specifies the height of a html element. Height has values similar
            to the width property but this property is mostly ignored. If the height of an element is not
            specified, then the page will become lengthier as you keep adding content.
          </dd>
          <dt>Min- and max- values:</dt>
          <dd>Min and max properties are used to write a very specific size to an element.
            For example, "<b>min-height:100px;</b>" - The minimum height given is 100px. Which
            means the element can only grow taller but no shorter than 100 pixels. The same process works for
            max-height too but in the opposite way.
          </dd>
        </dl>
        <p>By now we should be familiar with width and height. The min- and max- values are similar
          to the normal attributes but very specific. These minimum and maximum values are mostly used to
          write responsive CSS. The same CSS for a desktop can't be used for a mobile phone. The usual laptop
          screen is about 1300 pixels in length. The CSS used for a normal laptop will of course look normal, but
          on a giant screen (like 2500px in length) the sizes and spaces will look very different. That's why we
          specify the width using min and max-width.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          <img src="images\HtWt.JPG" alt="something went wrong!" style="float: left; margin:1.5em 1.5em 0 0">
          In the code, the height is set to 300px and the width to 700px. The text is affected by the width
          but the height doesn't change the text a lot. For clarity, a the background-color aquamarine is used
          for the selector. The #container element has a height of 300px but it has nothing to do with the text.
          There are other values to these properties like auto, inherit, min-content, fit-content, etc.
          These values are a little difficult to uderstand using only pictures, that's why we didn't include them in the content.
